## üîë Step 4: Set Up AI Provider (Choose One)

You need an AI service to power Praxis. Here are your options:

7. Put your key between the quotes: `api_key: "your-key-here"`
8. Save the file

### Option B: Local AI (Free but requires more setup)
**Cost: Free, but uses your computer's resources**

1. Download [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Install it
3. Open Command Prompt
4. Type: `ollama pull llama2:7b`
5. Wait for download to complete
6. Praxis will automatically use this local model

### Option C: OpenAI (More expensive but high quality)
**Cost: More expensive, $0.01-0.03 per request**

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up and add payment method

2. **Look for the Praxis icon in your system tray** (bottom-right corner of screen)
3. **Right-click the icon** to access the menu
4. **Click "Show Control Panel"** to open the main interface

## üéØ Step 6: Test Your Installation

1. **In the Control Panel, go to the "Tasks" tab**
2. **Type a simple request** like:
   - "What's the weather like today?"
   - "Tell me a fun fact about space"
   - "List the files in my Documents folder"
3. **Click "Submit Task"**
4. **Check the status** - you should see it working!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Python is not recognized"
- **Problem:** Python wasn't added to PATH during installation
- **Solution:** Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

### "Module not found" errors
- **Problem:** Dependencies not installed
- **Solution:** Run `python setup.py` again

### "API key invalid"
- **Problem:** Wrong API key or format
- **Solution:** Double-check your API key in `config\praxis_config.yaml`

### Agent doesn't respond
- **Problem:** AI service issues
- **Solution:** 
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. Verify API key is correct
  3. Try the local Ollama option instead

### "Permission denied" errors
- **Problem:** Windows security blocking access
- **Solution:** 
  1. Right-click `START_PRAXIS.bat`
  2. Select "Run as administrator"

## üí° Tips for Beginners

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic requests to get familiar with how Praxis works

2. **Check the Logs:** If something goes wrong, look at the "Logs" tab in the Control Panel

3. **Use Local Models:** If you're concerned about costs, set up Ollama for free local AI
